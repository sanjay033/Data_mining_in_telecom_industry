# Data Mining in telecommunications industry to study consumer behavior

## Context

Having a high teledensity of over 90, Kerala is proving to be a fierce ground for competition among service providers. Customer satisfaction is given a high priority by the service providers and hence it is imperative that they look into the factors that will cause customer retention and churning. ‘Data mining in telecommunications industry to study consumer behaviour’ is a scientific approach to understanding the consumer behaviour in the telecommunications industry in the context of the urban population of Trivandrum district, Kerala, India. 

## Data 

Data was collected from a sizeable sample whose size was found to be 554. The sample was chosen by convenience. For the purpose of data collection both online and offline survey methods were employed. According to the census report of the population of Trivandrum city, it could be understood that approximately 70% of the population aged between 20-60 years belong to the group of 20-40 years. This age category of 20-40 years also witnesses the highest percentage of internet users (approx. 55%). Hence a larger proportion of the survey was done online. 
360 respondents were obtained through online survey which was conducted through social media. 194 respondents were approached by offline survey in places that are generally considered to have a heterogeneous mixture of people.
To assess the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach’s α statistic was calculated. The reliability coefficient or the Cronbach’s Alpha value lies between 0 and 1.An alpha value greater than 0.65 is considered as acceptable reliability.  In our scenario, the Cronbach’s Alpha value is equal to 0.713, which is greater than 0.65. Therefore the questionnaire is reliable.

## Approach

The main techniques used regarding discovery based data mining are Cluster analysis and Associate Rule Mining. 

## Conclusion

The consumer behaviour in the telecom industry was studied. The various results regarding this study are:
* By the associate rule mining done on each cluster, we have obtained the result that the customer satisfaction is most for the service provider Idea followed by Airtel and Vodafone.

*	A predictive model was built using decision tree algorithm to predict the customer satisfaction and it was predicted that 70% of the population who have given a rating of more than 2.5 for network accessibility, customer service and tariffs are likely to be satisfied with the service provider. Similar predictions were made based on different combinations of variables however, the customer satisfaction in all these cases were less than 10%.

*	The different trends that explain the customer behaviour were found out using descriptive statistics.

*	The average ratings of various parameters like network accessibility, tariffs, billing/recharge services, package offers, and customer satisfaction were found out against the different service providers were found out.
